This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan 
from April 2005 to September 2005.

Some ideas for exploration:

1. How does the probability of default payment vary by categories of different demographic variables?
2. Which variables are the strongest predictors of default payment?
